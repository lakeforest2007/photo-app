## Photo-sharing Web Application

# Project overview

My goal was to develop a full-stack web application that allows users to upload and share photos and directly interact with other users through commenting and mentions. 
This was a 3-week long, individual project that taught me a lot about how to set up backend database and web servers such that they seamlessly interact with the frontend UI to create a single-page app that loads everything programatically.

# Application architecture

- Frontend frameworks/libraries: ReactJS, Material-UI
- Backend frameworks: MongoDB, Express.js/Node.js

# How you can interact with the project

1. Clone this git repository
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE and use `npm install` to fetch the dependant software packages
3. Install MongoDB and run it with `mongod [arguments]`
4. Load the photo app dataset into the data server with the command `node loadDatabase.js`
5. And start the Node.js web server with `node webServer.js` 

# Suggestions for improvements

If I had more time I would:
- Use feature branches
- 
- Deploy the app to Heroku
