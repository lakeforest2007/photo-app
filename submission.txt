************************************ Story One *******************
* Story number and name:  1 - Extend user profile detail with usage
* Story points:  3
* Brief description to see the story in action:
* This story extends the user detail page with two features - one shows the most commented photo and its number of comments, and the other shows the most recently
* uploaded photo of the user and time time of upload. Both features allow you to click on the image - this will take you to 
* the page that shows all of the photos of that user. If the user has no photos uploaded yet, user profile will not show photo details.

************************************ Story Two *******************
* Story number and name: @mentions in comments
* Story points:  6
* Brief description to see the story in action: 
* Type '@' to mention other users on the web app. Dropdown options are shown in the
* comment field as you type. You can then select a name from one of the options. If you enter the markup raw text
* manually, for example, '@[foo](abcd)', react-mentions will still recognize this as a mention in the comment textfield.
* However, once you enter, this mention will be rendered invalid and will show up in the published comment as 
* raw text '@[foo](abcd)'. The user details page is also extended to show the photos that mention the respective user, along with 
* the author of the photo, and you can click on these photos to go directly to the location of it (react-router-hash-link fragments are used).
